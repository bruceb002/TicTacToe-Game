# TicTacToe
In this Project, the user is able to play with a second player
whether it be a bot or another person.

## tictac.py 
This file was mostly implemented by my previous professor, Munishkina.
The only things I added were the inputs that took care of the bot 
situation.

## board.py
This file takes care of the existance and state of both the board
and the game.

## player.py
This file takes care of manipulating the board and allowing the players
to play their turns. Most of the bot was implemented here.
